I love to learn software development especially on backend field

On my work I'am usually to use Flask/Fastapi :snake: and Golang for building a backend service, packing my service using docker, connect my whole service using rpc, deploy that using gitlab/github ci/cd pipeline or manually with webhook trigger , and i still learn how to be better than that. :dart:

All of my task, I love to managed it's using jira, because it's my favorite management tool. 

I have experience on Frontend field also...
